## Task One: Reading in the data

### Question One: Reading in `data.txt` file

```{r}
?read_csv
```

CSV stands for Comma Separated Values. The data contained in the file data.txt are not comma delimited (they are semicolon delimited), so therefore we cannot use the function read_csv to read in this data file. 

```{r}
data <- read_delim("data/data.txt", 
                   delim = "; ", 
                   col_types = "ddd"
                   )
data
```

### Question Two: Reading in `data2.txt` file

```{r}
data2 <- read_delim("data/data2.txt", 
                   delim = "6", 
                   col_types = "fdc")
data2
```
